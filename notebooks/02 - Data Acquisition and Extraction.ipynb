    "A key to effective scraping is to understand how content and data is stored on web servers, how to identify the data you want to retrieve, an understand how the tools support this extraction.  In this chapter we will discuss website structures and the DOM, introduce techniques to parse and query websites with lxml, XPath and CSS.  We will also look at how to work with websites developed in other languages and different encoding types such as Unicode.\n",

    "Ultimately, understanding how to find and extract data within an HTML document comes down to understanding the structure of the HTML page, it's representation with DOM, the process of querying the DOM for specific elements, and how to specify which elements you need want to retrieve based upon how the data is represented.\n",

    "When the browser displays a web page it builds a model of the content of the page in a representation known as the DOM (document object model).  The DOM is a hierarchical representation of all content of the page, as well as structural information, style information, scripts and links to other content.  It is critical to understand this structure to be able to effectively scrape data from web pages.  We will look at an example web page, its DOM, and examine how to navigate the DOM with beautiful soup.\n",

First is that this element has three attributes: id, planet and name.  Attributes are often important in scraping as they commonly are used identify data embedded in the HTML.\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "XPath is a element of the XSLT standard, and provides the ability to select nodes in an XML document.  Since HTML is a variant of HTML, XPath can also be used to find elements in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "lxml is a python library created for manipulating HTML document.  One of the features of lxml is the ability to execute XPath statements against a document, which lxml will then return the resulting set of nodes to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "XPath itself is designed to model the structure of XML nodes, attributes and properties.  The systax provides means of finding items in the XML that match the expression.  This can include matching or logical comparison of any of the nodes, attributes, values or text in the XML document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can be combined to form very complex paths within the document.  It is also possible to navigate the document based upon relative positions, which helps greatly in finding data based upon relative instead of absolute positions within the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding XPath is essential to knowing how to parse HTML and perform web scraping.  And as we will see, it underlies and provides an implementation for many of the higher level libraries such as lxml.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## There's more...\n",
    "Xpath is actually an amazing tool for working with XML and HTML documents.  It is quite rich in its capabilities, and we barely touched the surface of it's capabilities to demonstrate a few examples that are common to scraping data in HTML documents.

    "A documents encoding tells an application how the characters in the document are represented as bytes in the file.  Essentially, the encoding specified how many bits there are per character.  In a standard ASCII document, all characters are 8-bits.  HTML files are often encoded as 8-bits per character, but with the globalization of the Internet, this is not always the case.  Many HTML documents are encoded as as 16-bit characters, or using a combination of 8 and 16-bit characters.\n",
